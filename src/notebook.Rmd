## Goal

The goal of this analysis is to try to find patterns in the raw data, and use them to learn something useful about apartment-hunting, and New York in general.

## Data

Dataset used for this project is [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data), and it contains various information about all listings in the so-called Big Apple from 2019.


```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
nycdata <- read.csv('../data/AB_NYC_2019.csv')
head(nycdata, 5)                                    #show first five listings
```

## The city

To help us truly understand this data, it is important to get to know the city of New York first.

Located on the far east coast of the United States, New York is its most pupulous city with over 8 million people.
It consists of five bouroughs - **Brooklyn**, **Queens**, **Manhattan**, **Bronx** and the **Staten Island** which has not been included in the dataset, so we will concentrate on the first 4.

It also has two airports, **JFK** and **LaGuardia**, which are the sixth and the twentieth busiest airports in the US respectively, handling around 100 million passengers every year, and they are both located in Queens.
